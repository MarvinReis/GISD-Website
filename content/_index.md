# GISD - German Index of socio-Economic Deprivation

With GISD our aims were to develop a regional socioeconomic deprivation index for Germany that (1) can be used to analyse regional socioeconomic inequalities in health and (2) provides a basis for explaining regional health differences in Germany.

Originally the GISD data archive was submitted to [GESIS Datorium](https://data.gesis.org/sharing/#!Detail/10.7802/1460). But as we plan to update GISD anually when new data from [INKAR](https://www.inkar.de) is available, it will be hosted at github.

If you need help with GISD please feel free to contact [FG 28 of RKI](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/Abt2/FG28/fg28_node.html) or file an Issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/Skeiwalkski/GISD).
